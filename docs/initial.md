# terra-plugins — product brief & initial architecture

## 1) vision & mission

**vision**
Make cloud infrastructure creation as simple and composable as front-end components—so anyone can spin up secure, production-ready stacks in minutes.

**mission**
Provide an open, plugin-based Terraform framework that:

* **generates** all required resources **and** the *least-privilege* permissions automatically,
* **links** resources via a **DAG strategy** to guarantee correct creation order and wiring,
* **teaches** best practices by default (secure defaults, tagging, naming, linting),
* is **extensible** (community plugins) and **commercializable** (pro plugins & support).

**one-liner**

> “terra-plugins: React-style components for Terraform with auto-permissions and DAG-linked stacks.”

---

## 2) goals & non-goals

**primary goals**

1. **Zero-friction scaffolding**: `terra init` → pick provider → choose plugins (e.g., EC2, S3, SQS) → get a working stack.
2. **Auto-permissions**: synthesize minimal IAM roles/policies from plugin I/O needs (principle of least privilege).
3. **Deterministic orchestration**: DAG engine computes dependency order; generates Terraform with explicit `depends_on` & output/input wiring.
4. **Secure by default**: encryption at rest, blocked public ACLs, least-privilege, mandatory tagging, drift/lint checks.
5. **Extensibility**: well-defined plugin spec (`plugin.yml`) with schema validation.
6. **Community-friendly**: easy contribution flow, clear governance, MIT+Attribution license already set.
7. **Commercial path**: optional pro registry, compliance packs, policy packs, and support SLAs.

**non-goals (v1)**

* Managing runtime app code (keep scope to infra/IaC).
* Being a full visual designer (CLI first; visual UI can be v2).

---

## 3) product pillars & principles

* **Composable**: small, focused plugins (“aws-s3”, “aws-sqs”, “aws-ec2”) → assemble stacks.
* **Predictable**: explicit metadata → deterministic graph → reproducible outputs.
* **Least-Privilege by construction**: permission synthesis based on declared actions (read/write/list) and resource ARNs.
* **Provider-agnostic core**: start with AWS; keep interfaces open for Azure/GCP.
* **Convention over configuration**: sensible defaults; advanced knobs available when needed.
* **Docs as UX**: examples first, copy-paste-able recipes, and clear error messages.

---

## 4) initial user experience (UX)

```bash
npx terra-plugins create my-stack
# or if installed globally: terra create my-stack
? Provider:  AWS
? Select plugins:  ▢ aws-vpc  ▣ aws-s3  ▣ aws-sqs  ▢ aws-lambda  ▢ aws-ec2
? Link resources using DAG suggestions?  Yes
? Generate least-privilege IAM?  Yes (recommended)
? Environment naming prefix:  prod
```

Output structure:

```
my-stack/
  terra.json                # project manifest (provider, plugins, links, policies)
  plugins/                  # resolved plugin sources (version-pinned)
  main.tf                   # generated (calls modules, wires outputs/inputs, depends_on)
  policies/                 # synthesized IAM JSON (reviewable)
  variables.tf              # surfaced inputs
  outputs.tf                # composed outputs
  README.stack.md           # auto docs (what was generated & why)
```

---

## 5) MVP scope (v0.1 → v0.3)

**v0.1 — core CLI & minimal plugins**

* Commands: `create/init`, `add`, `link`, `build`, `list`, `info`
* Plugins: `aws-s3`, `aws-sqs`, `aws-ec2` (basic)
* DAG engine: topological sort; auto-inject `depends_on` and `module.*` references
* IAM synthesis (alpha): map plugin intents → actions → resource ARNs; output JSON policies

**v0.2 — security & quality**

* Preflight checks: region, credentials, naming collisions, tagging policy
* Policy lints: deny wildcards, enforce resource-scoped permissions when resolvable
* Unit tests & golden file tests for generated Terraform
* `terra doctor` to analyze gaps (“permission missing for SQS:SendMessage”)

**v0.3 — developer platform**

* `terra create plugin` scaffolder
* Plugin registry bootstrap (JSON index + semantic versioning)
* Schema validation for `plugin.yml` (JSON Schema)
* Rich examples and copy-paste recipes

---

## 6) architecture (v1)

### 6.1 high-level components

* **CLI (Node/TS)**: commander + inquirer; commands: create/add/link/build/list/info/doctor
* **Plugin loader**: loads plugin folders (local or registry), validates schema, normalizes I/O
* **DAG engine**: builds graph from declared `depends_on` + inferred edges (from inputs satisfied by other plugins’ outputs)
* **Renderer**: handlebars/mustache → emits `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`
* **IAM policy synthesizer**:

    * Inputs: plugin capability declarations (e.g., `needs: s3:PutObject on bucket/*`)
    * Resolves concrete ARNs from known outputs (e.g., `module.aws_s3.bucket_arn`)
    * Minimizes actions; warns on unresolved scopes → falls back (guarded and flagged)

### 6.2 plugin metadata schema (draft)

```yaml
name: aws-sqs
version: 0.1.0
provider: aws
description: Managed SQS queue with optional DLQ
inputs:
  - name: queue_name
    type: string
  - name: source_bucket_name
    type: string
    optional: true
outputs:
  - name: queue_arn
  - name: queue_url
depends_on:
  - aws-iam-role?            # optional, if plugin can create its own if missing
capabilities:
  # declarative permission needs
  - actor: lambda?           # the principal that will need the permissions
    needs:
      - action: sqs:SendMessage
        resource: ${queue_arn}
      - action: sqs:ReceiveMessage
        resource: ${queue_arn}
suggested_links:
  - from: aws-s3.bucket_notifications
    to: aws-sqs.queue_arn
```

### 6.3 DAG strategy

* Build graph from `depends_on` + `suggested_links` + satisfied inputs/outputs
* **Toposort** → generation order
* Generate:

    * `module.<plugin>` blocks with version-pinned `source`
    * `depends_on` arrays for tricky cycles
    * Variable wiring: `module.source.output → module.target.input`

### 6.4 IAM synthesis strategy (least-privilege)

1. Each plugin declares capability intents (`needs`).
2. The build phase resolves concrete resource identifiers (ARNs) from other plugin outputs.
3. Merge capability intents across plugins per **principal** (e.g., a shared IAM Role), deduplicate actions/resources.
4. Emit JSON policy docs into `/policies` with human-readable rationale sections.
5. If resolution incomplete → warn & mark with `TODO: review`. Fail with `--strict`.

**example**
Choosing S3 + SQS + Lambda:

* S3 plugin outputs `bucket_arn`, `bucket_name`.
* SQS plugin outputs `queue_arn`, `queue_url`.
* Lambda plugin declares:

    * needs `s3:GetObject` on `${bucket_arn}`
    * needs `sqs:ReceiveMessage` on `${queue_arn}`
* Synthesizer generates one role with those exact actions on those ARNs.

## 8) docs you can paste into `/docs`

### 8.1 README.md (starter)

````md
# terra-plugins

React-style components for Terraform. Pick provider, choose plugins (S3, SQS, EC2), and terra-plugins generates resources, links them via a DAG, and synthesizes least-privilege IAM for you.

## Quickstart
```bash
pnpm dlx terra-plugins create my-stack
cd my-stack
terra build
terraform init && terraform apply
````

## Why terra-plugins?

* Composable plugins
* Auto DAG linking
* Least-privilege IAM synthesis
* Secure defaults & best practices
* Extensible community registry

````

### 8.2 SECURITY.md (starter)
```md
# Security

- Least-Privilege by default. Generated IAM policies are scoped to concrete ARNs when resolvable.
- `terra doctor` flags wildcards and unresolved scopes; `--strict` fails the build.
- Secrets: never written to repo; uses Terraform variables/TF Cloud for sensitive values.
- Report vulnerabilities: security@yourdomain (PGP welcome).
````

### 8.3 CONTRIBUTING.md (starter)

```md
# Contributing

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. `pnpm install`
3. `pnpm build`
4. Add a plugin: `pnpm --filter @terra/plugins create aws-thing` (scaffold)
5. Write tests (`packages/core` has golden tests)
6. Run CI locally: `pnpm test`
7. Open a PR with a clear description and examples.
```

### 8.4 GOVERNANCE.md (starter)

```md
# Governance

- BDFL: Ángel Rojas Pacheco (project lead).
- Maintainers: listed in MAINTAINERS.md.
- Decisions: RFC process in /rfcs, lazy consensus, security veto power to maintainers.
```

### 8.5 LICENSING.md (starter)

```md
# Licensing

- Code: MIT with attribution (see LICENSE).
- Trademark: "terra-plugins" is a project name and should be preserved in derivative works per license notice.
- Third-party dependencies: respect their licenses.
```

### 8.6 ROADMAP.md (starter highlights)

```md
- v0.1: CLI core, S3/SQS/EC2 plugins, DAG engine, IAM synthesis alpha
- v0.2: Policy lints, terra doctor, examples, tests
- v0.3: Plugin scaffolder, registry bootstrap, schema validation
- v0.4+: Lambda, API Gateway, RDS, VPC; Azure/GCP adapters; visual builder (beta)
```

---

## 9) commercialization track (ethical & OSS-friendly)

* **Open Core**: core CLI + community plugins stay MIT+Attribution.
* **Pro Packs (paid)**:

    * Compliance bundles (CIS, PCI, SOC2 policy packs)
    * Enterprise plugins (PrivateLink, multi-account guardrails)
    * SSO & policy delegation + audit trail
* **Support**: SLAs, onboarding, architecture reviews.
* **Hosted Registry (later)**: private plugin catalogs for teams.

---

## 10) next concrete steps (action list)

1. **Repo bootstrap** with pnpm workspaces; add `packages/cli`, `packages/core`, `packages/plugins`.
2. Implement CLI `create`, `add`, `link`, `build` with inquirer flows.
3. Define **`plugin.yml` schema v0**; implement validator.
4. Implement **DAG engine** (toposort) and **Terraform renderer** (handlebars).
5. Implement **IAM synthesizer (alpha)** with a few action maps:

    * S3 (GetObject, PutObject, ListBucket)
    * SQS (SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, DeleteMessage)
    * EC2 (Describe*, Start/Stop if required by plugin intent)
6. Ship **three example stacks** in `/examples` with copy-paste apply steps.
7. Wire **CI**: typecheck + tests + golden snapshots of generated `.tf`.

---

if you want, I can now generate:

* `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
* `package.json` scripts
* the **exact TypeScript skeletons** for `packages/core` (loader, DAG, renderer, policy synth)
* and the **first two plugins** (`aws-s3`, `aws-sqs`) with minimal working Terraform + `plugin.yml`.

say the word and i’ll drop the files scaffolding so you can paste them in and run `pnpm install && pnpm -w build`.
